### **Key Observations**
1. **`ahci 0000:00:17.0: Found 1 remapped NVMe devices`**  
   - This indicates that the NVMe SSD is detected, but it’s currently being handled under the RAID configuration.
2. **RAID Mode Detected**:
   - Your system is using RAID for the SATA controller (`00:17.0 RAID bus controller`). This can cause issues with NVMe SSD detection in Linux, as Linux expects AHCI mode for full compatibility.

---

### **Steps to Fix**

#### 1. **Switch from RAID to AHCI Mode**
The RAID setting is likely preventing your Linux system from properly detecting the NVMe SSD.

- Reboot your system and enter the BIOS setup (usually by pressing `F2` during boot).
- Navigate to **SATA Operation** or a similar setting.
- Change the setting from `RAID` to `AHCI`.
- Save changes and exit the BIOS.

---

#### 2. **Prevent Boot Errors (If Dual-Booting with Windows)**
If Windows is also installed on your system, switching to AHCI mode might cause it to fail to boot. To prevent this:
1. Boot into Windows (while still in RAID mode).
2. Enable Safe Boot:
   - Open `msconfig` (Windows + R → type `msconfig`).
   - Under the **Boot** tab, check **Safe Boot**, and select **Minimal**.
3. Reboot, enter BIOS, and switch to AHCI mode.
4. Boot into Windows again, disable Safe Boot, and reboot normally.

---

#### 3. **Verify NVMe Detection in Linux**
Once AHCI mode is enabled:
1. Boot into Linux and check if the NVMe SSD is recognized:
   ```bash
   sudo lsblk
   ```
2. Verify PCIe devices:
   ```bash
   sudo lspci | grep -i nvme
   ```
3. Check for block devices:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```

If the SSD is now listed, proceed to partition and format it.

---

#### 4. **Partition and Format the SSD**
1. Create a partition table:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
   ```
2. Format the partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p1
   ```
3. Mount it:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt
   ```

### **If the Issue Persists**
1. **Update Your BIOS**:
   - Download the latest BIOS for your Dell Inspiron 5570 from [Dell Support](https://www.dell.com/support).
   - Update the BIOS following Dell’s instructions.

2. **Kernel Updates**:
   Ensure your Linux kernel is updated, as newer kernels improve hardware support:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. **Force Re-scan NVMe Devices**:
   Try rescanning for NVMe devices manually:
   ```bash
   sudo echo 1 > /sys/class/block/nvme0n1/device/rescan
   ```

4. **Recheck Dmesg Logs**:
   After making changes, recheck for any errors or clues in the logs:
   ```bash
   sudo dmesg | grep -i nvme
   ```



#explanation:

When your BIOS SATA operation is set to **RAID**, the system expects multiple drives to be combined into a RAID setup. In this mode, it often uses special RAID drivers to communicate with the storage devices, which may not fully support detecting standalone NVMe SSDs.

When you change the mode to **AHCI**, the BIOS switches to a more universal way of managing storage devices. AHCI is designed to work with individual drives and fully supports NVMe SSDs. That’s why, after switching to AHCI, your NVMe SSD became visible to the BIOS.

In short:
- **RAID mode:** Looks for RAID setups, which can hide standalone drives like NVMe SSDs.
- **AHCI mode:** Works better with single drives and fully supports NVMe SSDs.
